# Customer-Segmentation-and-Profiling
Customer segmentation is a pivotal task for business analytics. Customer segmentation is  the process of splitting customers into different groups with similar characteristics for  potential business value proposition. Many companies find that segmenting their customers  enable them to communicate, engage with their customers more effectively. Future Bank is conducting an analysis on the existing customer profiles and the marketing  campaign data to identify the target customers who are mostly likely to subscribe long-term  deposits. As a member of the data analytics team, I am tasked to analyse historical data  and develop predictive models for marketing purposes. I have used SAS Enterprise Miner and Rstudio to perform the analysis.
